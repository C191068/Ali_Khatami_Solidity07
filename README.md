###Oracle and chainlink

To convert ethereum to USD, oracle and chainblink are needed.The USD value of ethereum is something that we have assigned outside of the blockchain to each ethereum.
In order to get any value that is outside of the blockchain we have to use decentralized oracle network to get the price of one ether in bterms of USD.
We have to note that blockchain are deterministic systems which means they can interact with real world data and events.It can do any external computation.
Blockchains can't all agree on what random number is.If we start adding random that return from API(Application programme interface) call, diiferent nodes <br>
will get differnt results and they would never reach a consensus.Such problem is called smart contract connectivity problem or Oracle problem.<br>
For this problem we can't replace smart contracts with traditional agreements and traditional agreements neeed data and they need to interact with real world.
